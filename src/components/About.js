            <h3>My name is Tony Scalfaro.</h3>
            <p>I am a recent graduate of FullStack Academy and a professional Software Engineer. After my military enlistment, I attended Temple University. Though my time there was put on pause to attend FullStack, I will be back to finish the remaining year part-time. This wild journey has given me so many different tools to lean on a variety of situations. I have strong experience in javascript, react, and express. I also have experience in database management and creation using PostgresQL. I am looking for a work environment that keeps me interested in learning more every day, pushing the boundaries of my ability.
